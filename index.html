        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            The NHL has a storied history starting in 1917. The league began with only 5 Canadian teams and has grown to 31 teams across the country today with a 32nd team to be added in the next few years.
            The NHL is seen as the premier league around the world, attracting talent from many different countries, and is still continuing to try and grow their international brand. The first U.S. team was
            the Boston Bruins, added in 1924. During the time period between the founding in 1917, league membership grew to 10 members but then dropped back down to 6 after 1942. These six teams are referred
            to as the Original Six. There was no further growth or loss until 1967, when the NHL added a professional sports record of six new teams all based in the United States. From this first wave of
            expansion until the NHL merged with another league, the WHA (World Hockey Association), in 1979. During this "era", there were new teams being added consistently every few years until 2000 when
            the league reached 30 teams.
