# Activity_2

This activity was to provide us a basic understanding of how Github works in correlation with a project. It was also to help us 
reintroduce ourselves to working in HTML and CSS, something we will be doing later on in the semester.

For this activity, I created a website discussing a bit of the history of the NHL, I also added links to external sites that will 
provide more information to the user.
